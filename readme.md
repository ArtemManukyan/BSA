# Binary Studio Academy's first homework

---

Hello everyone! This project (let's call it project) was made to get some skills about working with Git and GitHub and to force my brain to recall the most intresting stuff that I've read at the last time.

The "excerpt.md" file contains one of the chapters of one of my favorite books - "Одноэтажная Америка", which was published in English by the name of "Little Golden America", even though it should rather be "One-Storeyed America". This particular chapter is telling about autor's visit of the Ford's manufacturing and meeting Henry Ford himself. I've also added some comments on some words (like footnotes) and rectified English-to-Russian transliteration that always bugged me. I won't leave a link to the full book (afraid to be taken to jail for pirate content dissemination), but [here's a link](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Одноэтажная_Америка) to Wikipedia's article about it.

The "article.md" file contains an article about the scrutiny on how owr organism reacts when we decline of coffee. The author of this article decided to avoid drinking coffee for a few weeks and paraphrased his findings in a short way.
